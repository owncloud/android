   account. The supported operations for files in spaces are: download, upload,
   remove, rename, create folder, copy and move. The documents provider has been
   adapted as well to be able to browse through spaces and perform the operations
   already mentioned.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3851

* Enhancement - Update label on Camera Uploads: [#3930](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3930)

   will skip status.php in case it's successful, and in case the lookup server is
   not directly accessible, we will continue the authentication flow with the
   regular status.php.

* Bugfix - Small glitch when side menu is full of accounts: [#3437](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3437)

   Previously, when users set up a large number of accounts, the side menu
   overlapped the available space quota. Now, everything is contained within a

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3060
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3437

* Bugfix - Small bug when privacy policy disabled: [#3542](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3542)

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/2524

* Enhancement - Brute force protection: [#3320](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3320)

   Previously, when setting passcode lock, an unlimited number of attempts to
   unlock the app could be done in a row. Now, from the third incorrect attempt,
   there will be an exponential growing waiting time until next unlock attempt.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3320
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3463

* Enhancement - Lock delay for app: [#3344](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3344)

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3344
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3375

* Enhancement - Allow access from document provider preference: [#3379](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3379)

   provider when there was a lock set in the app. Now, a new preference has been
   added to allow/disallow the access, so users have more control over their files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3438

* Enhancement - "Open with" action now allows editing: [#3475](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3475)

   Previously, when a document file was opened and edited with an external app,
   changes weren't saved because it didn't synchronized with the server. Now, when
   you edit a document and navigate or refresh in the ownCloud app, it synchronizes
   automatically, keeping consistence of your files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3381

* Bugfix - Passcode input misbehaving: [#3342](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3342)

   entering them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3342
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3365

* Bugfix - Lack of back button in Logs view: [#3357](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3357)

   buttons of the device.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3357
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3363

   trying to delete a large number of files. Now, the application has been fixed so

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3362
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3380

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3418

   picker shows the folder that the user browsed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3163
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3431

* Bugfix - Logging does not stop when the user deactivates it: [#3436](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3436)

   Previously, when users disabled the logging option in the settings, the
   application would not stop logging and the size of the log files would increase.
   Now, the option to disable it works perfectly and no logs are collected if
   disabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3325
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3436

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3385

* Enhancement - Scoped Storage: [#2877](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2877)

   The way to store files in the device has changed completely. Previously, the
   files were stored in the shared storage. That means that apps that had access to
   the shared storage, could read, write or do whatever they wanted with the
   ownCloud files.

   Now, ownCloud files are stored in the Scoped Storage, so they are safer. Other
   apps can access ownCloud files using the Documents Provider, which is the native
   way to do it, and that means that the ownCloud app has full control of its
   files.

   Furthermore, if the app is removed, the files downloaded to ownCloud are removed
   too. So, files are not lost or forgotten in the device after uninstalling the
   app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2877
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3269

* Enhancement - Delete old logs every week: [#3328](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3328)

   Previously, logs were stored but never deleted. It used a lot of storage when
   logs were enabled for some time. Now, the logs are removed periodically every
   week.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3328
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3337

* Enhancement - New Logging Screen 2.0: [#3333](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3333)

   A new option has been added to the logging screen, so that now it's possible to
   share/delete log files or open them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3333
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3408

* Enhancement - Delete old user directories in order to free memory: [#3336](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3336)

   Previously, when users deleted an account the synchronized files of this account
   stayed on the SD-Card. So if the user didn't want them anymore he had to delete
   them manually. Now, the app automatically removes the files associated with an
   account.

   If an external editor modifies a file, the new size will not match when it is
   assembled in server side. Fixed by removing the if-match header from the proper

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2752
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3220

* Bugfix - Fix a bug when some fields where not retrieved from OIDC Discovery: [#3202](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3202)

   Problem when requesting the OIDC discovery was fixed. Some fields were handled
   as mandatory, but they are recommended according to the docs. It prevented from
   a proper login. Now it is possible to login as expected when some fields are not
   retrieved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3202
   https://github.com/owncloud/android-library/pull/392

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3204
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3234

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3221

* Change - Hide biometrical if device does not support it: [#3217](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3217)

   Biometric lock preference in "Security" settings subsection was shown even when
   the device didn't support biometrics (if it was Android 6.0 or later versions).
   Now, the preference is only shown if the device has the suitable hardware for
   it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3217
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3230

* Enhancement - Settings accessible even when no account is attached: [#2638](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2638)

   Now, settings can be accessed via a button in the login screen, removing the
   necessity to have an attached account. However, auto picture and video uploads
   won't be available until an account is registered in the app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2638

   framework. In addition, they have been reorganized into subsections for a better
   understanding and navigation structure. Also, new features have been added: now,
   source path and behaviour in auto uploads can be chosen differently for pictures
   and videos.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2867
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3143

* Enhancement - Replace blank view in music player with cover art: [#3121](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3121)

   For music files that does not have cover art embodied, it is displayed a
   placeholder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3121
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3182

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3177

* Enhancement - Fixed account for camera uploads: [#3166](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3166)

   Camera uploads will be uploaded to a fixed account independently of the current
   account. Removing the account attached to camera uploads will disable this
   feature. User will be warned when removing an account that has camera uploads
   attached.
