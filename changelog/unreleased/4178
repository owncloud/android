Change: Fix "Copy here" button visibility after rotation in folder picker

The "Copy here" button could stay visible when showing the space list after a device rotation.
It now updates correctly and is only shown when browsing inside a space (MainFileListFragment),
not when viewing the space list (SpacesListFragment).
